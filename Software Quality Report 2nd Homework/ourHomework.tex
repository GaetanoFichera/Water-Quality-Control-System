\newpage \chapter{\textbf{Our Homework}}

The task in this second homework is to create a Performance Model based on the system that we have modeled in the first homework. Using the Sequence Diagrams, we built the Execution Graph, and, through the Deployment Diagram we have built a Queueing Network. From the analysis of the Execution Graph we obtained the Demand Vectors that we used to parameterize the Queueing network. After that, the network has been
resolved through a tool in order to obtain the output parameters that would allow to evaluate the system performance.
In the final phase through the Architectural Description Language Aemilia we had the possibility to have a further evaluation of the system's performance.
