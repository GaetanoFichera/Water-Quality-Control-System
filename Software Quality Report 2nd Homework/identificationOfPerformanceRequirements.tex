\newpage \chapter{\textbf{Identification of performance Requirements}}


The following consideration has been made: \\
1 Km of the route with respect to the connection point with the system is taken into account for an Entry Water Channel or Exit of 5 meters radius, and every 10 meters must be 10 Seaweed Picking, with a total of 1000 Seaweed Picking. \\
Non-functional requirements are:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Each sensor must take 500 ms to carry out a sampling;
\item The time tat passes between a sampling and the other is 60 s;
\item The time that each node must use to send the data to the archive 			is 200 ms;
\item The time of use of each node must be less than 90%;
\item The response time of the Archive after a call by an actor must not 	exceed 300 ms.
\end{itemize}
