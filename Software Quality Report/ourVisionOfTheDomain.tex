\chapter{\textbf{Our Vision Of The Domain}}
To make the Homework funnier we have decide to introduce some technologies we are not sure exist like:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\large \textbf{SeaweedPicking}}

\begin{description}
\par particular "mechanical algae" placed at precise points of the water pipes. They are equipped with advanced water samplers that draw small amounts of water to be sent to the analysis center, each SeaweedPicking is connected to an internal network that will head the Control Center
\end{description}

\item {\large \textbf{Magikarp}}

\begin{description}
\par in the event of contamination detection in inlet water pipes, "mechanical fish" is sent to search for the possible cause inside the pipelines, it will automatically look for the cause of the problem and send the data to the Control Center. They are equipped with advanced water sampler and analyzer in order to speed up the recovery process
\end{description}
 
\end{itemize}

Activities in the our system can be attribute into three macro areas:

\begin{itemize}

\item {The Sampling Aspect}
\begin{description}
the activities dedicated to the sampling water
\end{description}

\item {The Quality Control Aspect}
\begin{description}
the activities dedicated to the water quality monitoring and discovering of possible problems and their causes
\end{description}

\item {The Water Retrieving Information Aspect}
\begin{description}
the services provided to the Company to retrieve information about the water quality
\end{description}

\end{itemize}
