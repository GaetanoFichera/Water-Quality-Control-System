\chapter{\textbf{Our Conclusion}}

During the development of this homework we have faced for the first time with the abstractation thinking about classes and meta-classes. At the beginning we had difficulty because before this we though only about class and object view of an application domain. 
\\Also we used for the first time MagicDraw and we appreciate its functionality. It is much better from another UML CASE tool that we used in the past named Visual Paradigm. At first we were disoriented, especially building Profiles, later we found certainty during the creation of the Diagram Component.
