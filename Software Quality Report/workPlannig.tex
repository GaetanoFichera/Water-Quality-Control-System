\chapter{\textbf{Work Plannig}}
The first step of our work was to plan the various stages of the work. We have never managed such application domain so our first care was to study it consulting some domain expert and reading some documents online in order to understand how to design our model and imaging future possible stakeholders of the systems.
\\After that we restricted our software model to a single portion of the system: the Water Quality Control System, in particular the inlet water pipes and the outgoing water pipes building the corresponding profile.
\\On the basis of the concerns of the stakeholders we have made the Use Cases Diagram and their detailed versions. Then we designed the Component Diagram driven by the Use Cases Diagram and for each Use Cases we have made a Sequence Diagram.
\\In the end we have done the Deployment Diagram.
