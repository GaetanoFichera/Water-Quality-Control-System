\section{\textbf{Deployment Diagram}}

The Deployment diagram shows how the various parts of the system are distributed
physically. This diagram represents the physical architecture of the whole system.
There are three center linked between them: Control Center, Analysis Center and a Purification System. Inside the Control Center, the node where we focused our attention, there a Qs Sampling App linked to the Seaweed Pickings, one for inlet and other for outgoing water pipes, also there is a QS Quality Control App involved to control the Magikarp node. Magikarp and Seaweed Picking nods are linked to their Qs Apps through a wireless connection defined in our Profile. Both of Qs Apps are linked to the Water Company Server connected to the DB. Also there an other node, the Qs Water Info App, concerned to retrieve information from Water Company Server.
