\chapter{\textbf{Our Homework}}
The task is to profiling and modeling a Water Distribution, Leakage And Quality Control System. In this area we are required to model a WCS through UML, using the extension mechanism called profiling.
\\First we have designed the Profile of this kind of systems and then we have modeled it through the use of these UML diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use Case Diagram;
	\item Deployment Diagram;
	\item Component Diagrams;
	\item Sequence Diagrams.
\end{itemize}
Since the extension of the domain, the task left many decision points to be analyzed. So we have limited to model only a part of the whole system.
